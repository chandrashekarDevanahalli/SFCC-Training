Please practise more and most important try to visualize the recursion.
Coming week Weekdays we have doubt session also in this topic */

, For Subset || problem , if the output is in different order , i think the test cases are failing

/**
 *  Little bit update in the sequence of topic , Yes , 
 * backtracking  & DP is based on recursion but teaching backtracking & DP in the 
 * initial classes will be little advanced for many candidates. So we start
