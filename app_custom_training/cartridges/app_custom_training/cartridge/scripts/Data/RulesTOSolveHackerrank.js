/**
 * Q. Why should we solve questions on HackerRank if they're present on LeetCode as well?
A. Well, there are many reasons why we prefer candidates to solve these questions 
first on HackerRank and then only go to LeetCode. Let's discuss them one by one:
Suppose you have written a code for the problem Search Insert Position and you 
compile your code. It compiles successfully and even passes all the Sample Test Cases.
 Now, you submit your code and 12/20 test cases passed. HackerRank won't show you which
  test cases failed whereas LeetCode will tell you exactly for which test case your code
   ain't working. When you know the failing test cases, it becomes easy to dry run the code 
   and figure out where exactly you went wrong. That's not the same case when you don't the 
   failing test cases. In those cases, you have to go through each logic inside the code and 
   figure out yourselves which test cases will fail for the code. I want everyone to learn how 
   to do this because in every step of your hiring process, you will experience this. In Online 
   Assessments (OA), they won't show which test cases are failing; your interviewers won't tell 
   you where your logic is failing. For this reason, I said that you should solve questions on 
   LeetCode but only after solving them on HackerRank first.
LeetCode has in-built array given as their input parameters whereas HackerRank has ArrayList 
provided in their questions. This gives you a chance to practice in both types of arrays in order 
to be comfortable with both the libraries so that it doesn't come up as a surprise to you in an OA.
 Same goes for Vectors in C++.
It helps us track each user's performance. Why can't we do it in LeetCode? Well, LeetCode doesn't show 
us how much duration a user solved a particular question in. Plus, we cannot track any of the user's 
code in LeetCode. It won't show me how a person has solved a particular problem whereas HackerRank will. 
This is important because a candidate can solve the Peak Index in a Mountain Array problem either by using
 Binary Search or by Linear Search.
Q. What if I'm not able to solve any particular problem in HackerRank?
A. If you're having some difficulty in solving the problem, I would recommend spending some extra time on
 that problem yourself to debug the error. But even after that, if you don't reach to the solution, you can 
 reach out to me and he'll help you out with the solution.
